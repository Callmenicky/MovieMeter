## Development server: 

To start a development server, run `ng serve`. Then, navigate to [http://localhost:4200/](http://localhost:4200/) in your web browser. The application will automatically reload whenever you make changes to the source files.

## Code scaffolding:

You can use the `ng generate` command to generate various components. For example, you can create a new component using `ng generate component component-name`. Additionally, you can use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module` to generate other project elements.

## Build:

To build your project, execute `ng build`. The resulting build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. If you want to create a production build, add the `--prod` flag to the command.
